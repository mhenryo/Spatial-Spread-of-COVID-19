Replication materials (code and data) for our published findings that can be found in our paper ["Socio-economic and demographic factors influencing the spatial spread of COVID-19 in the USA"](https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJCEE.2022.126313) published in International Journal of Computational Economics and Econometrics. 

In this paper, we analyse population-adjusted confirmed case rates based on daily US county-level variations in COVID-19 confirmed case counts during the first several months of the pandemic to evaluate the spatial dependence between neighbouring counties and quantify the overall spatial effect of socio-economic demographic factors on the prevalence of COVID-19.
