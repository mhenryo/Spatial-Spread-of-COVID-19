# spatial-spread-of-COVID-19
We analyse population-adjusted confirmed case rates based on daily US county-level variations in COVID-19 confirmed case counts during the first several months of the pandemic to evaluate the spatial dependence between neighbouring counties and quantify the overall spatial effect of socio-economic demographic factors on the prevalence of COVID-19.
