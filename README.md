# spatial-spread-of-COVID-19

Replication materials (code and data) for our published findings in ["Socio-economic and demographic factors influencing the spatial spread of COVID-19 in the USA"](https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJCEE.2022.126313), published in the International Journal of Computational Economics and Econometrics journal. 

In this study, we analyse population-adjusted confirmed case rates based on daily US county-level variations in COVID-19 confirmed case counts during the first several months of the pandemic to evaluate the spatial dependence between neighbouring counties and quantify the overall spatial effect of socio-economic demographic factors on the prevalence of COVID-19.

The Stata Program folder contains all the needed programs to reproduce Tables 1-4, and the county-level choropleth maps in the Appendix showing the evolution of population-adjusted COVID-19 case rates for March 1, April 1, April 30, and the last date referenced in the analysis, May 23, 2020.
